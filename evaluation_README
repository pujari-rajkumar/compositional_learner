1. To generate visualizations for 'politicians on all issues' (Fig. 5 and Appendix Fig.s 4-13) and 'comaprison of politicians stances on issues' (Fig. 4), you may run:

                                    python3.6 visualizations.py

	It runs on CPU and will take 2-5 secs to finish


2. To generate results of 'NRA Grades Paraphrase Task' (Tab. 4), 'NRA Grade Prediction Task' (Tab 5., Fig. 4 and Appendix Fig. 2), LCV Score Prediction Task (Appendix Tab. 1, Fig.s 1 & 2), you may run:

                                    python3.6 grade_prediction.py

  
       This also runs on CPU and may take up to 30 minutes to finish. It is trains and evaluates a GradePredictor feed-forward neural network 320 times (5 random seeds * 8 training data sizes * 4 models * 2 tasks). We didn't provide the option of GPU because it doesn't take too much time to finish.


3. Both the scripts will generate plots as .png  images in the data/ folder. grade_prediction.py generates training output in data/grade_pred_log.txt.

4. We provided representations generated by all models for all entities for all issues in the data/ folder. They are named entity_issue_<model_name>.pkl. We haven't released the Compositional Reader code yet. We will release learning tasks code and data upon acceptance.

5. Required depencies and packages:

python3.6+
torch
matplotlib
scikit-learn
numpy
pickle
csv
random
